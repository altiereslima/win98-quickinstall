See "mercypak.txt" for file format details.

MercyPak is not buildable for MS-DOS with the current source. Once WATCOM compatibility is added back, it will be.

The MERCYPAK.EXE UNMERCY.EXE files built from the previous source remains.

Use build.bat to build on Windows or build.sh to build on Linux.

This is not intended to be used anywhere outside the Windows 98 QuickInstall environment, it expects the appropriate compiler to be present.
