According to the New Eridu resident records, her identity as "Anby Demara"
only exists after joining Gentle House, the name obviously being taken 
from Nicole. Before registering as an employee of Gentle House, all data
relating to Anby is suspiciously blank.

Despite her extreme lack of common sense, Anby is well-versed in matters
related to combat and is among the strongest combatants of the Cunning 
Hares.

Anby's greatest interest is movies, of which she likes an extensive range of
genres. Due to an excessive obsession, she tends to take the stories in
movies as reality.

Contrary to her seemingly emotionless appearance, Anby is easily moved by
movie storylines.

Her favorite food is hamburgers because "they contain protein, carbs, and
greens, taste good, and are even affordable -- there's nothing else besides
hamburgers."

Rumors suggest Nicole found Anby near the ruins of the old capital and took
her in because she was impressed by her formidable combat abilities.

"It's not because she's strong! I took her in because I'm kind~" -- Nicole

Anby's behavior and combat performance suggest she has had military
training. Due to the suspicious gaps in her history, it's advised to
maintain a certain level of vigilance towards her.
